ant -f C:\\Desa\\afc\\afc-rest run
C:\Desa\afc\afc-rest\nbproject\build-impl.xml:258: The Java EE server classpath is not correctly set up - server home directory is missing.
Either open the project in the IDE and assign the server or setup the server classpath manually.
For example like this:
   ant -Dj2ee.server.home=<app_server_installation_directory>
BUILD FAILED (total time: 0 seconds)


Clean builds did not help me, either. I took a look at project.properties and found that j2ee.server.home was not set anywhere, although j2ee.platform.classpath depends on it.
I do have Weblogic Server set up under /home (on a Linux machine).
So, I closed the project and added a line to project.properties:
j2ee.server.home=/home/blister/wls/wlserver
(where wlserver = the server name)
